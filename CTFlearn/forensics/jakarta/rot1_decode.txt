this challenge is designed to help build the skills for solving 
my 100 point scope challenge.

hidden inside this jpeg are the following:
a* a 4096 bit rsa public / private key pair .pem file that
has been xor'd with bytes from the jpeg to encrypt the key file.  the offset into the
jpeg to start the xor operation is not known.

b* i have provided two python scripts to do the above xor
operation )one python script calls the other*- finding the correct
offset into the jpeg file

c* a flag encrypted with the rsa private key from part a*

you can use the two python scripts as part of solving my 
scope challenge which is worth 211 points.

the concepts shown in the python scripts can also be used as a basis 
for solving my vargasisland challenge.

you will need to modify the python scripts provided.
if you are new to python here are some good free online courses:

have fun!

if you are struggling to find the hidden files in this jpeg-
you may want to solve my mountainman challenge before solving this
challenge.

twitter dm's and discord dm's are open zkcbowhunter- but you need to do some work on your own first.
i don't give out hints if you haven't done any work.

if you are new to ctf and are not sure where to start then you may 
want to try some lower point forensic challenges first:
rubber duck
snowboard
pikes peak
