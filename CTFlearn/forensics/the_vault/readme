Welcome to CTFlearn Challenge "The Vault" by kcbowhunter

This challenge is designed to be a little more difficult than my other jpeg / Forensics challenges.
It is similar to NightHawk... there is no formula or recipe to follow, just some clues.

For those of you who do not speak English as your native language, the poem provided as a hint:

Roses are Red
Violets are Blue
What is in this Vault
Is not meant for you

is a hint of course, but the solution to the challenge doesn't have anything to do with colors.  This is just a common short
format for an English language poem where the first two lines are 'Roses are Red, Violets are Blue...'.  The two lines
after this are a big hint for the challenge.

I am including two Python scripts that I wrote to help solve the challenge.  The first Jpeg1.py shows the location
and size of all the data chunks in the jpeg file.  If you are not familiar with the jpeg file format, it might
help to google 'jpeg file format markers'.

The second Python script ExtractBytes.py is used to extract bytes from a binary file, and it's a handy script for
extracting bytes from Jpeg files.  The script works on any binary file format, to the script it's just a binary file.

If you find these scripts useful feel free to use them to solve other CTF challenges.

I am available on Twitter and Discord as @kcbowhunter to help answer questions, but I won't give many hints on this
challenge until we have the first 10 solvers on the ctflearn website.  Good Luck!
