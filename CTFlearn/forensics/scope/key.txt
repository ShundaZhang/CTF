I can't believe it.

They finally figured out that we moved Nicky's apartment 3 years ago.  Of course it was in the same building
complex but we got her a flat on the top floor right between two microwave towers.

We collected so much data from that location.

But now it's all over.  Nicky is gone and Igor just ran into my office like a madman yelling
"Jason's RSA private key is encrypted using xor with the Jason scope jpeg.  But there is also an AES
key hidden in the jpg.  What the heck???".

He was so far gone though he didn't say much more.  So it sounds like Jason encrypted his private RSA key using
the scope jpeg as a one time pad but we don't know the offset into the jpeg where he started his
one time pad xor operation.

We need to find that flag and I bet Jason encrypted it using AES CBC 256 (if I know Jason).
But that AES key is probably encrypted with the RSA public key.

So find all these keys inside the jpg and then find that flag.
