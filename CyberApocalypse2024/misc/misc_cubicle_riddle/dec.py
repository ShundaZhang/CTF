While journeying through a dense thick forest, you find

yourself reaching a clearing. There an imposing obsidian

cube, marked with a radiant green question mark,halts your

progress,inviting curiosity and sparking a sense of wonder.

As you approach the cube, its inert form suddenly comes to

life. It's obsidian parts start spinning with an otherwordly

hum, and a distorted voice emanates from withing, posing a

cryptic question that reverbates through the clearing,

, shrouded in mystery and anticipation.

> Riddler: 'In arrays deep, where numbers sprawl,
        I lurk unseen, both short and tall.
        Seek me out, in ranks I stand,
        The lowest low, the highest grand.

        What am i?'

(Answer wisely) > 151,0,100,1,125,1,100,2,125,2,124,1,124,2,122,0,0,0,125,3,124,0,124,3,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,120,1,125,1,125,2,124,0,68,0,93,19,125,3,124,3,124,2,107,4,0,0,0,0,114,3,124,3,125,2,140,11,124,3,124,1,107,0,0,0,0,0,114,2,124,3,125,1,140,20,124,1,124,2,102,2,83,0

Upon answering the cube's riddle, its parts spin in a

dazzling display of lights. A resonant voice echoes through

the woods that says... HTB{r1ddle_m3_th1s_r1ddle_m3_th4t}
