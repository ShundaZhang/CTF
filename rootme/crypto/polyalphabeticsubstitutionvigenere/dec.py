The Hacker Manifesto

Another got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Scandal: Teenager Arrested for Computer Crime,
"Arrest of a 'hacker' after the hacking of a bank" ...

Satan kids, all the same.

But have you, in your three-piece psychology and your profile
technocratic of 1950, one day thought of looking at the world behind the eyes of a hacker?
Have you ever wondered what made her act, what forces had shaped her?
I am a hacker, enter my world ...
Mine is a world that starts with school ... I'm smarter than most other kids, I get bored of the bullshit they teach me ...

I am in college or high school. I have listened to the teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.
I understood it. "No Mme Dubois, I can't show my work. I did it in my head"
Satane kids. He certainly copied it. All The same.

I made a discovery today. I found a computer.
Wait a minute, that's cool. It does what I want. If it's wrong, it's because I messed up.
Not because he doesn't love me ...
Nor because he feels threatened by me ...
Nor because he thinks I'm a little trickster ...
Nor because he doesn't like to teach and shouldn't be there ...
Satan kids. All he does is play. All The same.

And so it happened ... a door opened to the world ...
Rushing through the telephone line like heroin through the veins of an addict, an electronic pulse is sent,
We are looking for a refuge from the daily incompetence ... a server is found.

You keep repeating that we are all the same ...
We were spoon-fed baby food at school when we were hungry for a steak ...
The pieces of meat we were left with were pre-chewed and tasteless.
We have been dominated by sadists or ignored by apathetic.
The only ones who had things to teach us found volunteer students, but these are like drops in dessert.

This is our world now ... The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We're using an already existing service, Without paying what could be cheap if it wasn't owned by greedy profiteers, and you call us criminals.
We explore ... and you call us criminals.
We seek knowledge ... and you call us criminals.
We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious dogma ... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you finance wars,
You don't punish the Mafia bosses with the rich lawyers,
You murder and cheat, you manipulate and lie to us trying to make us believe it's for our own good, and we are still criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity.
My crime is to judge people by what they think and say, not by how they look.
My crime is to outdo you, something you will never forgive me for.

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.
You can arrest this individual, but you cannot arrest all of us ...
After all, we are all the same.
